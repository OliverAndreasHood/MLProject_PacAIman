## Description
The aim of the project is to prepare our own version of PacMan and adapt it to machine learning.
The model will be trained in four stages:
- Learning to move in the game without enemies and reinforcements
- Moving in the presence of enemies without a buff
- Moving in the presence of enemies with a buff
- Optimization of the number of points scored and the time to finish the game
